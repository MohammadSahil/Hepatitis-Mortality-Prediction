# Hepatitis-Mortality-Prediction

## About
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.

## Description
In this project I used a Hepatitis Prediction Data set from UCI machine learning repository to analyse the Hepatitis Mortality. I used ML model as back end and used HTML and BOOTSTRAP as front end and used Flask as a rest API to launch my project as an API. This project is a typical beginner project of the entrance to the world of data science.
